# Group_1-Reproducible-CCBG-pipe

This is a group 1 mini-project about *Reproducing a published workflow for bacterial genome*

# We are required to:
- Collaborative on the project using git hub 
- Learn from each other and carry out tasks in the event we are assigned any
- By the end of the project submit a reproducible workflow e.g. in Snakeamke
- Observe proper script documentation, should be informative
- Use visualizations
- Write a report about the mini project

# Specifically to our mini project we are required to:
- Download the sequence data programmatically using an API
- The project uses CCBGpipe implemented in Python is available and packaged in Docker for reproducibility. 
  Our first task is to reproduce the analysis as in documented in study README
- Reproduce the analysis workflow used for genome assembly of Oxford Nanopore MinION using Nextflow or Snakemake, and Singularity for containerization.
  Remember as a group we settled on Snamake workflow

# Question
In your report, you should address the following question:

- Are you able to arrive at similar conclusions as those in the paper? Why or why not?
- What else can you glean from your re-analysis?
- Are the descriptions in the methodology section detailed for reproducibility? If not, what could you have done to improve reproducibility?
