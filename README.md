# Group:1-Reproducible-CCBG-pipeline

This is a group 1 mini-project about **Reproducing a published workflow for bacterial genome**

# We are required to:
- Collaborative on the project using git hub 
- Learn from each other and carry out tasks in the event we are assigned any
- By the end of the project submit a reproducible workflow e.g. in Snakeamke
- Observe proper script documentation, should be informative
- Use visualizations
- Write a report about the mini project

# Specifically to our mini project we are required to:
1. Download the sequence data programmatically using an API
2. The project uses CCBGpipe implemented in Python is available and packaged in Docker for reproducibility. 
   Our first task is to reproduce the analysis as in  the documented study README
3. Reproduce the analysis workflow used for genome assembly of Oxford Nanopore MinION using Nextflow or Snakemake, and Singularity for containerization.
   Remember as a group we settled on Snamake workflow

# Question
In our report, we should address the following question:

1. Are we able to arrive at similar conclusions as those in the paper? Why or why not?
2. What else can we glean from your re-analysis?
3. Are the descriptions in the methodology section detailed for reproducibility? If not, what could we have done to improve reproducibility?
